# Applied-Bioinformatics-Honours

## Python Introductory Course
Weekly Python tasks involving the use of Pandas and Numpy. This serves as preparation for my honours research project whereby various bioinformatics tools will be used to analyse cellular heterogeneity in normal vs. colorectal cancer tissue using single-cell RNA sequencing data.

## Single-Cell RNA Sequencing
1) SRA files are downloaded from the EMBL-EBI website using the `prefetch` command. These files are then converted to FASTQ format using the `fasterq-dump` command.
